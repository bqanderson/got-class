# Got Class? - Ruby on Rails Tutorial

This is my first attempt at a Ruby on Rails application. I will be creating a simple
display of my favorite D&D characters, both preset and past. I hope to show each
characters basic stats as well as a brief bio.

Things I want to cover in this tutorial:

* Ruby version

* System dependencies

* Configuration

* Database creation

* Database initialization

* How to run the test suite

* Services (job queues, cache servers, search engines, etc.)

* Deployment instructions

* ...
